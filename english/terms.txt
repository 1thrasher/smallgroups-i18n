That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);

You also give other Smallgroups.church users and non-users permission to search and share your publicly available Content on other Smallgroups.church sites and add their own Content to it (aka to reblog your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your site.

If you delete Content, 1thrasher will use reasonable efforts to remove it from our Services, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, 1thrasher has the right (though not the obligation) to, in 1thrasher’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in 1thrasher’s reasonable opinion, violates any 1thrasher policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason, in 1thrasher’s sole discretion. 1thrasher will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
