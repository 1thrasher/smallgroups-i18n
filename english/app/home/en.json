    "Q1": {
      "QUEST": "How does Smallgroups.church work?",
      "ANS1": "Smallgroups.church is a small groups management system and online directory. Pastors and/or coordinators invite  group leaders to create accounts, then leaders create their own groups — which are approved or declined by administrators. Church members may browse the directory and (optionally) sign up for groups. Our reporting data gives you an overview of the health of your small groups ministry while taking away much of the legwork of actually managing them."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "QUEST": "Is this service actually free to use?",
      "ANS1": "Yes! As we launched Smallgroups.church, we felt that God was calling us to give it away for no cost. Now we can help more local churches have successful small groups!"
    },
    "Q3": {
      "QUEST": "Is there a catch?",
      "ANS1": "Nope. We may offer premium services in the future, but you will be included in the \"Free Forever\" plan. No features will ever be taken away and bundled into a premium offering if they have ever been previously free to use.",
      "ANS2A": "We've also considered incorporating vetted, Christian-appropriate advertisements into the website and/or emails. Should we do this, rest assured we will be 100% transparent, provide the ability to opt-out, and",
      "ANS2B": "we will never sell or otherwise share any personally-identifiable data."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "QUEST": "Can I create the groups, or does the group leader have to do it?",
      "ANS1": "You can do it either way, though we highly encourage you to empower your group leaders to create their own groups.",
      "ANS2": "If you create the group for your leaders, then you can invite the group leader to be a co-leader of the group. Once they sign-up, you'll have the option to transfer the group to them.",
      "ANS3": "But, we have found that you will get more \"buy in\" if the group leaders create their own groups. They'll feel a sense of ownership over their group, and as you grow, you'll be glad you're only having to approve the group, not enter all the details for tens or hundreds of groups."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "QUEST": "Does each group leader need to have administrative privileges?",
      "ANS1": "No, once a group leader creates his/her account and small group, they will have all the priviliges they need to manage their group."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "QUEST": "We have a lot of different ministries, not just small groups. Can I customize Smallgroups.church?",
      "ANS1": "Sure, we encourage it! Our filters include broad definitions for who, what, when, and age, all of which can be customized to your specific church's requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "QUEST": "Do you support multiple campuses?",
