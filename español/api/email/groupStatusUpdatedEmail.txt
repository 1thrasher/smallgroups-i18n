Next steps:

  - Pray for the people who will come. Pray that God will use you in a powerful way as you lead.
  - Invite your friends, neighbors, coworkers, and strangers to join your group. Donâ€™t just expect people to show up -- they often need a personal invitation.
  - Be ready when your group launches. Preparing shows your group members that you care about them.
