Subject: New company, updated policies, same people

Smallgroups.church is part of a new company, 412.church, LLC!

We are still the same people running things since the beginning, but with a new name. As a result, our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have been updated.

You should read our new policies in full, but the key updates include:

  - Our policies reflect the new company name, 412.church, LLC
  - We've made a better attempt at describing how we collect, use, and share your personal information;
  - You may adjust our email and marketing efforts;
  - We would hate to see you go, but you may now easily close your account

Sincerely,
Ira Thrasher
Co-founder, SmallGroups.church
