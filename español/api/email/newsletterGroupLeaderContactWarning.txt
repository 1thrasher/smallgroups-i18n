Subject: Communication update for Smallgroups.church

Dear small group leaders:

It has come to our attention that a scammer has attempted to use SmallGroups.church to receive payments in gift cards by contacting small group leaders. Currently, only one church has been targeted.

Remember that anyone can send a message to you through the "Contact Leader" button on the small group directory. Please use good common sense and be careful with sharing information with people who contact you. 

SmallGroups.church will never contact you for payment or request your password or other personal information.  

Sincerely,
Ira Thrasher
Co-founder, SmallGroups.church
