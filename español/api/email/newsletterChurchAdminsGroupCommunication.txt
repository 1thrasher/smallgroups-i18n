Subject: Security update to Smallgroups.church

Dear church administrators:

It has come to our attention that a scammer has attempted to use SmallGroups.church to receive payments in gift cards by contacting small group leaders. Currently, only one church has been targeted. We have already notified all small group leaders of this issue.  

To protect your church members, we have temporarily disabled the "Contact Leader" button on the small groups directory. This will prevent anyone from contacting your small group leaders through SmallGroups.church.

If you would like to re-enable the "Contact Leader" feature, please go to your Church Dashboard, click Resources, then Communication Settings.

Remember that anyone can send a message through the "Contact Leader" button on the small group directory. Encourage your leaders to use good common sense and be careful with sharing information with people who contact them. 

Sincerely,
Ira Thrasher
Co-founder, SmallGroups.church
